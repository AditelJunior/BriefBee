    This Privacy Policy explains how BriefBee ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use the BriefBee Chrome extension.
  </p>
  <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
  <p>
    BriefBee does not collect or store any personal information from users. The extension processes data locally in your browser and does not transmit your data to any external servers, except as required to provide its core functionality (such as sending selected content to AI APIs for brief generation).
  </p>
  <h3>Use of Information</h3>
  <p>
    Any information processed by BriefBee is used solely for generating project briefs as requested by the user. We do not sell, share, or use your information for any other purpose.
  </p>
  <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
  <p>
    BriefBee may use third-party AI services (such as Google Gemini) to generate briefs. Only the minimum necessary data is sent to these services, and it is not stored by BriefBee.
  </p>
  <h3>Data Security</h3>
  <p>
    We take reasonable measures to protect your information. However, please be aware that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure.
  </p>
  <h3>Changes to This Policy</h3>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page.
